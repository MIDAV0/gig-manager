# Database management system

The majority of the solution's code is in the schema.sql file, with the java code mainly used for database interaction and executing sorted queries. To ensure a reliable and user-friendly solution, I employed FUNCTIONS and VIEWS in PostgreSQL. In the java code, I use try-catch blocks to handle errors and ensure that prepared statements and result sets are properly closed after use.

I'm proud to say that my program successfully passed all of the provided test cases, including scenarios with invalid inputs and queries. In cases where errors occur, the database remains unchanged. Overall, I believe that my solution is both robust and effective.
